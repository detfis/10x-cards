## Project Description

10x-cards helps learners drastically reduce the time and effort needed to create high-quality flashcards. By pasting any text (e.g., a textbook excerpt), the application calls an LLM API to generate suggested question-and-answer flashcards. Users can review, edit, accept, or reject suggestions, then store approved cards in their personal library, all secured behind user authentication. A spaced repetition algorithm schedules review sessions to optimize learning retention.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- Astro 5
- React 19
- TypeScript 5
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Shadcn/ui component library

**Backend**
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database & Auth)

**AI Integration**
- Openrouter.ai (access to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc., models with cost-control features)

**CI/CD & Hosting**
- GitHub Actions for build/test/deploy pipelines
- Docker on DigitalOcean for production hosting

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.15.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Git
- A Supabase project (for database & auth)
- Openrouter.ai API key

### Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/10x-cards.git
cd 10x-cards
nvm use
npm install
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```ini
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
```

### Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` (or the port indicated in the terminal) to view the app.

## Project Scope

### In-Scope (MVP)

- AI-driven flashcard generation from user-provided text
- Manual flashcard creation, editing, and deletion
- User authentication (register, login, delete account)
- Integration with an open-source spaced repetition algorithm
- Secure, scalable storage of users and flashcards using Supabase
- Basic generation statistics (AI-generated vs. accepted)
- GDPR compliance (data access & deletion on request)

### Out-of-Scope (Future)

- Custom SRS algorithm or advanced notifications
- Gamification features
- Native mobile applications
- Bulk import of document formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- Public API or flashcard sharing between users
- Advanced search and filtering of flashcards
